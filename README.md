# untitled-drinking-game v2

Public, cleaned up version of the drinking game I designed in college for get-togethers.

This project uses firebase / firestore- allowing a lot of funtionality, including user created decks.

This project is intended to be fun, don't use it as an excuse to peer pressure. Please drink responsibly.
